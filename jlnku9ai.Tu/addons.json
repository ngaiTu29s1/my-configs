browser speed and reduce memory load and when you have numerous open tabs.","fullDescription":"\"Auto Tab Discard\" is a lightweight browser extension that automatically reduces the amount of memory used by open but inactive tabs, helping to conserve battery life on portable devices by disabling JavaScript code and DOM events on discarded tabs.\n\nPreview:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ityhxUPp3y8\n\nInstruction:\n\nThere are two options on the extension's interface to either discard tabs or release discarding (the \"x\" buttons)\n\n\nThe features of \"Auto Tab Discard\" are:\n\n* Improves browser performance and reduces memory usage by automatically or manually discarding inactive, idle, or forgotten tabs.\n* Includes a list of hostnames or regular expressions that can be excluded from auto-discarding.\n* Preserves the discarded state of tabs when the browser is closed and reopened.\n* Indicates the discarded state of a tab through the favicon or title.\n* Restores the state of a tab, including scroll position and text box content, after it is released from being discarded.\n* Allows for the forced discarding of specified hostnames.\n\n\nThe options for configuring whether tabs should be discarded or not include:\n\n* Pinned tabs\n* Tabs that are playing media\n* The presence of a power source\n* Unsaved content or user input in a tab\n\nThe available plugins for \"Auto Tab Discard\" are:\n\n* Release the discarded state of the next or previous tab.\n* Release the discarded state of all tabs in the active window.\n* Automatically discard all newly opened inactive tabs.\n* Store YouTube's timestamp before a tab is discarded.\n* Permanently delete (remove) old discarded tabs that are inactive.\n\nNotes:\n\n* Unlike the \"The Great Suspender\" extension, this extension uses the native method for discarding tabs, which means that even if the extension is removed or the browser crashes, your browser will automatically restore everything for you.\n\nPrivacy

Enter tokens automatically without re-typing for better security!\n\nThe 2FAS extension allows you to log in to any online service with 2FA enabled, faster!\n\nEasy set up in three steps:\n1. Install the extension on your desktop browser\n2. Open the 2FAS app on your phone and pair your phone with your desktop browser\n3. Start using the 2FAS extension\n\nWhen you want to log in using a 2FA token, simply select 2FA token input field, click the 2FAS extension icon, and confirm login on your phone!\n\nSecure and fast log in.\n\nSimply pair the service you want to login to with your 2FAS app, then 2FAS will automatically select your token for future logins, no searching or typing required!\n\nFree access — no account required.\n\n2FAS is an easy-to-use authentication app that protects access to your online services and accounts.\n\nRelying on a single password for your personal accounts, like Facebook or Instagram, often puts your data and sensitive information at risk.\n\nThe 2FAS Authenticator App generates one-time codes called Time-based One-time Passwords (TOTP) or HMAC-based (event-based) One-time Passwords (HOTP) for your account. By creating these codes offline and changing them every 30 seconds or every login, 2FAS drastically increases the security of your information.","weeklyDownloads":318,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"2FAS","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/17433836/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/296/296975.png?modified=1710798667","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/296/296975.jpg?modified=1710798667","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Tap on Phone for 2FA Code"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/278/278694.png?modified=1710798663","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/278/278694.jpg?modified=1710798663","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Select input"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/278/278695.png?modified=1710798663","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/278/278695.jpg?modified=1710798663","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Select 2FAS extension"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/278/278696.png?modified=1710798663","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/278/278696.jpg?modified=1710798663","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Accept/approve the push notification on the mobile app"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/278/278697.png?modified=1710798663","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/278/278697.jpg?modified=1710798663","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Extension fills in your security token"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":3.9231,"reviewCount":36,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2fas-two-factor-authentication/reviews/","updateDate":1729522560000},{"id":"{47bf427e-c83d-457d-9b3d-3db4118574bd}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2276/2276008-32.png?modified=e033a7a5","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2276/2276008-64.png?modified=e033a7a5","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2276/2276008-128.png?modified=e033a7a5"},"name":"nightTab","version":"7.3.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3848032/nighttab-7.3.0.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/zombieFox/nightTab","supportURL":"https://github.com/zombieFox/nightTab/","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nighttab/","description":"A neutral new tab page accented with a chosen colour.
